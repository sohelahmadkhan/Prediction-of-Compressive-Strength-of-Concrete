Conventional concrete is a mixture of cement, water, and coarse and fine aggregates. Supplementary components such as 
chemical and mineral admixtures may be added to the basic concrete ingredients to enhance its properties in fresh or
hardened state. The procedure of selecting appropriate ingredients for concrete and its relative amount with the aim of 
producing concrete of obligatory strength, workability, and durability as cost-spinning as possible is termed mix design. 
The development of tools to find the optimized mix proportions has been the subject of research during the last more than four 
decades. The aim of any proportioning process is to determine an ample and cost-effective material to make up the concrete, 
which can be used in its fabrication, as near as possible to the chosen properties. The engineering properties of cement-based 
materials and special concretes depend on various parameters including the nonhomogeneous nature of their components and the 
intrinsically different properties of various elements and sometimes on the twin and/or contradictory effects of some ingredients
on the overall concrete performance. Therefore, a clear understanding of such complex behavior is needed in order to successfully 
use these materials in various engineered structures. In recent years, many researchers have been working on developing accurate 
concrete compressive strength prediction models [1â€“11]. The prediction of compressive strength of concrete has great connotation, 
if it is brisk and consistent because it offers an option to do the essential modification on the mix proportion used to avoid
circumstances where concrete does not attain
the mandatory design strength or by avoiding concrete that is gratuitously sturdy and also for more economic use of raw material and f
ewer construction failures, hence reducing construction cost. So prediction of compressive strength of concrete has been an 
active area of research.
